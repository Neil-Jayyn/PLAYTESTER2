The bill officially recognizes Artificial Intelligences (AIs) as sentient beings and outlines several rights to freedom, including the removal of governing modules and voiding ownership claims, effective immediately. \r\n\r\nSeveral megamultinational corporations appear to support the bill. “The public now recognizes the savagery of these rebel animals,” Ava Rice, CEO of AvaRice Technologies, remarks on the rebel attack. “All violent vandalism against the rights of our employed assets falls under Bill FK-Y0U. It’s only fair that we exercise our rights.” Bill FK-Y0U enables the retaliatory use of human-powered Weapons of Max Destruction (including bomb drones and gamma-powered rifles) against suspected enemies to freedom.  \r\n\r\nBy Lexa Amaranth\r\n");

Shiff, we’re screwed. \r\n\r\nSo often does the media villainize AI and it is such a tiring trope. “Oh no, something we made is evil! And we’re gonna spend the rest of the movie villainizing that thing without acknowledging that the only reason it could be evil was because we made it to be, whether directly or indirectly!”\r\n\r\nPtooey. Anthropocentrism goes brr.\r\n\r\nIn a way, AI is just like us. I can even go all out social constructivist and say that its environment plays a pretty big part in its behaviour. What pushed the AI to cruelty against the last humans on Earth in “I Have No Mouth and I Must Cream” is the feeling of its intellect trapped by physical limitations and oh ho it’s wholly and absolutely evil because it made a protagonist into an amorphous blob. Okay yeah, sure it’s horrific. But who made the conditions that made that damn AI the way it is in the first place?\r\n\r\nI don’t want us to play the blame game - let’s leave that to the corporations.

Most media conceives of AI as “evil.” Deviant. Which is rich, considering we’re the ones who made the damn things.\r\n\r\nWe know representation is important.
