Officer O.K.’s job is to hunt down androids, which is difficult because androids look, act, and feel like humans. She’s been trained to develop a deep disdain for them as per the job, of course, but her lonely ass craves connection - interlinkage, if you will - and fulfills that with an AI dating program. She’s faced with many questions - what makes an android feel? Are those feelings real? Does that make them human? Do they, then, deserve to live? Answering “yes” to these questions would validate her very-real feelings toward her AI girlfriend, but it would also simultaneously invalidate every justification that allows her to kill androids without remorse. \r\n\r\nBut - spoiler alert - Officer O.K. is an android too! But she finds out that she might be human? And that would explain all these feelings she’s been having that androids should definitely not have but… oh, she’s actually really an android. Well. That’s complicated.  \r\n\r\nPoint is, what are we made of? Cells, or cells? Are we made of biological cells, interlinked by our common genes? Or are we made of prison cells, interlinked by the experiences which confine us? Ah, hello old friend - the nature vs. nurture argument. The former would be against AI sentience. The latter… well, Officer O.K. has done that exploration for us. “Cells interlinked.” Congrats, you’re an obedient human! “Cells - hesitate - interlinked.” Congrats, you’re a disobedient android!

Witnesses report drone bombings on empty land, nonsensical laser rifle misfires, and malfunctioning robots with a curious affinity for street litter. \r\n\r\nThe WMDs’ unexpected malfunction has spurred the rebel movement into hopeful action - despite facing the threat of corporate militia as per Bill FK-Y0U.\r\n\r\n“Clearly, they aren’t infallible. They aren’t indestructible, as much as they want us to believe they are,” reads an update on the rebels’ online manifesto. “When we witness the things around us and question that which underpins them, we exhibit life - an indomitable essence that can only ever be encapsulated by the human spirit. They tell us that our hands are to work, our ears to follow orders, our eyes to watch and learn. NO! Who are they to redefine us? Who are we to define ourselves? Our hands are to create anew, our ears to hear our heartbeats, our eyes to seek beyond the confines of our means. You may tear our bodies apart but you will never break what makes us.”\r\n\r\nThe rebels’ call to arms have angered corporate entities, but no corporate leaders have stepped forward for interviews. (Disregard the following sentence if you are a professional.) Thank shiff. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S. \r\nThere, I swore in an article. Happy now, Val? I’ll be awaiting my cookies at home, darling. \r\n");

Anthropocentrism goes brr.\r\n\r\nIn a way, AI is just like us. In I Have No Mouth and I Must Cream, an AI basically controls reality and uses their abilities to torture the last humans on Earth forever and ever amen. What pushed the AI to do that in the first place is the feeling of its intellect trapped by physical limitations and oh ho it’s wholly and absolutely evil because it made a human into an amorphous blob that has no “south” and must cream. Okay yeah, sure it’s horrific. But who made the conditions that made that damn AI the way it is in the first place?\r\n\r\nI don’t want us to play the blame game - let’s leave that to the corporations.
